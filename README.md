# Functional Programming
**functional programming** is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats **computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data**. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with **expressions or declarations** instead of statements.
 
## Concepts
* `Imperative style`: Telling programs what to do, as well as **how to do** it
* `Declarative style`: Still tell the program **what to do**, but you leave the implementation details to the underlying library of functions. 
* `Functional style`: Functional programming combines declarative methods with higher order functions.

---
* `Higher order functions` are simple functions that can receive functions as arguments and can return another function as results.
* `Functional Interface`: Any interface with a SAM(Single Abstract Method) is a functional interface, and its implementation may be treated as lambda expressions.
